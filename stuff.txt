small styling stuff to do later:
 add a border around the svg 
 make the hull colored differently 
 show the points as dots -> make them always on top
 be able to hover/click lines instead of points


needed features:


wanted features:
- click to add a point 
- check if curr triangulation is delaunay 
- click two points to flip the edge between them 
- input box to input points (and either way def print a list of pts)
- clear all pts button


what's a halfedge? 


d3.polygonLength exists if i want to do the closeness-to-delaunay thingy

maybe doing trees is the best way? 

producing a non-delaunay triangulation: given two algorithms. first requires computing triangulation of convex polygon (which shoulddd be easy?) and second requires checking if a point is "visible" to another point 

so the idea is probably - so every triangulation of S has the same number of triangles / edges. so have a list of those edges for delaunay and check/match those against whatever the current triangulation looks like to check if it's delaunay or not 

for now the problem isn't that yet though - how can we click a line and have it go the other way? separate out the hull, make interior points gray on hover. a line is attached to two triangles, click it and that line disappears and add one at the other two corners of the two triangles

I thiiiiink that means iterate through delau.trianglePolygons() and pull 


the on hull check isn't gonna be enough, some triangulations will be impossible without being on the hull


input: selecting an edge is real annoying bc of how I'm printing triangles instead of edges here, but maybe select two points? that's kinda easier even 




deleting points now works
adding now works but I can no longer delete or flip because the events are mixed up

ideally would like to put a border around the svg area 



rectangle no longer appearing again (but flips work)
points dont disappear on deletion / sometimes dont appear on creation 
flipping points works til you add one and then no longer does


let background = chartGroup
            .append("rect")
            .attr("x", 0)
            .attr("y", 0)
            .attr("width", chartWidth)
            .attr("height", chartHeight)
            .attr("color", "blue")


ok so showTriangulation is fucking up POINTSGROuP somehow so the event no longer functions
